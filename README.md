# Hands-On Machine Learning Implementation

This repository contains my implementations and exercises based on the book:

**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow**  
by *Aurélien Géron*

The goal is to deepen my understanding of machine learning by coding through all major concepts and examples.
